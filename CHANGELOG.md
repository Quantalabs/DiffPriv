# **v0.0.2**
## New Functions

Added the new Laplace Mechanism. A new method which allows for much more capability. This allows you to import .csv files and deferentially privatize the data and keep the original data too.  It will create a new file for the deferentially privatized data. It also allows for any float value instead of just 0 or 1 like it is with random response. But here are all the advantages of the Laplace Mechanism function in DiffPriv.

| :+1: |
| :----: |
| More Flexibility in your data and values | 
| Allows for .csv files to be used |
| Allows for _both_ datasets to be kept (the original and privatized data) |
| Flexibility on how privatized your data can be and how much it can be altered by using the epsilon parameter |

## Fixes

None

## Uploading from PyPI

     python3 -m pip install DiffPriv==0.0.2
