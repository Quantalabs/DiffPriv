# v1.0.0rc
## Bug Fixes
- Security Fix with commit 46f3363.
    With the diff and enc modules, parameters were stored in python memory, and never removed. This commit deletes these parameters and helps prevent attackers from gaining access to these parameters, which can help them gain access to the original text and/or data.

## New Features
None.

# **v0.0.2**
## New Functions

Added the new Laplace Mechanism. A new method which allows for much more capability. This allows you to import .csv files and deferentially privatize the data and keep the original data too.  It will create a new file for the deferentially privatized data. It also allows for any float value instead of just 0 or 1 like it is with random response. But here are all the advantages of the Laplace Mechanism function in DiffPriv.

| :+1: |
| :----: |
| More Flexibility in your data and values | 
| Allows for .csv files to be used |
| Allows for _both_ datasets to be kept (the original and privatized data) |
| Flexibility on how privatized your data can be and how much it can be altered by using the epsilon parameter |

## Fixes

None

## Uploading from PyPI

     python3 -m pip install DiffPriv==0.0.2
