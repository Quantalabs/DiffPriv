Welcome to DiffPriv's documentation! DiffPriv is a differential privacy package
meant to allow data to be kept private while still allowing overall statistics and
other general facts about the data to stay the same. DiffPriv has 3 different
algorithms. Random Response, the Laplace Mechansim, and the Exponential mechaism.

In this tutorial, we'll cover how to insall and use the differential privacy
mechanisms. So what are you waiting for? Let's get started!
