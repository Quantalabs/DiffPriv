# Welcome to DiffPriv v0.0.2

DiffPriv is a collection of different defferential privacy algorithms. From the Laplace Mechanism
to the simple Random Response mechanism, use differential privacy in your data easily with _DiffPriv_.

### Our world is full of data. Our world *is* data.
#### So let's protect it. Easily.

## Downloading DIffPriv
To download, open up you command prompt and type

    python3 -m pip install DiffPriv==0.0.2


## How to Use

The first method we will use is the _Random Response Mechanism_. To use this, we use the `random` function.
You only need to pass *one* parameter. 

    random(response_list)
    
Response list, the parameter, is the list of data or responses in a form. 

The next method we can use is the _laplace mechanism_. To use the laplace function, we use the `laplace()` function.

    laplace(data, file_name, epsilon, f, sample_size=10, delta_f=None)
    
This will return a new dataset that is differentially privatized. @q9i's differential privacy wiki page on the laplace mechanism is a great explainer. You can view it [here](https://github.com/quantum9Innovation/Differential-Privacy/wiki/Doing-Complex-Stuff-...).
