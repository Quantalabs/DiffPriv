DiffPriv is a collection of different defferential privacy algorithms. From the Laplace Mechanism
to the simple Random Response mechanism, use differential privacy in your data easily with _DiffPriv_.

### Our world is full of data. Our world *is* data.
So let's protect it. Easily.

## How to Use
The first method we will use is the _Random Response Mechanism_. To use this, we use the `random` function.
You only need to pass *one* parameter. 

    random(response_list)
    
Response list, the parameter, is the list of data or responses in a form.
