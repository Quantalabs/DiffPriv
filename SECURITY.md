## Reporting a Vulnerability

Contact @Quantalabs at `npm.quantalabs@gmail.com`. **Do not** post an issue or any other public information about to vulnerability, 
so that we can issue a patch release with a fix and prevent attacks on users. The patch will be issued within a max time of 90 days,
and if no fix can be issued, then the release will be yanked from PyPI and an advisory will published.
