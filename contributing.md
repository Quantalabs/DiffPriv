# :mega: Attention Contributers

For all of you who want to add different mechanisms and algorithms to DiffPriv, you better listen up!

## New Mechanisms/Algorithms

For new mechanisms and algorithms, create a new function in the [privatize.py file](https://github.com/Quantalabs/DiffPriv/blob/master/DiffPriv/private.py). Make sure it is titled properly and works. Then create a pull request and wait for me to accept it \(or decline, but let's be positive and say accept\).

## Editing Existing Mechansims

### Bugs

If you are changing a bug, create an issue and then \(hopefully\) fix it in the file. Again, make sure that it works.

### Efficiency

If you are changing a function to make it more efficient, make sure to again create an issue and fix it. And most importantly, **make sure it works**.

## New Files

When creating a new file, make sure it has a good purpose. Then, create your new file and put some functions \(that fit the purpose of the file\) in it. Then create a pull request \(make sure to describe the updates well\) and you're done.
